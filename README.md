# üìù Sign-up Form Project - The Odin Project Intermediate HTML & CSS

## üöÄ Project Overview

This **Sign-up Form** was built as part of *The Odin Project‚Äôs Intermediate HTML and CSS Course*.  
The goal was to design a visually appealing, accessible, and semantically structured sign-up page for an imaginary service using **pure HTML and CSS**, applying layout, form, and validation concepts learned throughout the course.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Split Layout Design:** The page is divided into two main sections ‚Äî an image sidebar and the form container ‚Äî aligned using Flexbox.  
- **Custom Background Image:** A high-resolution photo from Unsplash creates an engaging visual identity.  
- **Logo Overlay:** The ‚ÄúODIN FEST‚Äù logo is displayed over a semi-transparent dark background to enhance text readability.  
- **Custom Local Fonts:** One font (`Super Festival`) is integrated via `@font-face`, adding personality to the design.  
- **Visual Form Validation:**  
  - Green borders and ‚úì icons indicate valid input.  
  - Red borders and ‚úñ icons indicate invalid input.  
  - Password fields use regex pattern validation (`^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d).{8,12}$` for at least one number, one lowercase and one uppercase letter).  
- **Interactive Button Design:** ‚ÄúCreate Account‚Äù button includes hover transitions and a subtle shadow.  
- **CSS Variables:** Used for consistent color theming and easy future adjustments.  
- **Accessibility Considerations:** Proper `label` associations, placeholders, and contrast management for readability.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Semantic form structure and accessibility-friendly markup.  
- **CSS3 (Flexbox):** For layout management, responsive alignment, and form styling.  
- **Custom Fonts:** Implemented via `@font-face` using locally hosted `.woff2` and `.woff` files.  
- **No JavaScript:** The project intentionally relies solely on CSS and HTML validation for this stage of the curriculum.

## üí° What I Learned & Reinforced

Through this project, I solidified key front-end skills:

- **Advanced CSS Selectors & Pseudo-classes:** Practical use of `:valid`, `:invalid`, and sibling selectors for real-time form feedback.  
- **Form Validation with Regex:** Controlled password strength via the `pattern` attribute.  
- **Custom Fonts Integration:** Loading local fonts and managing performance with `font-display: swap`.  
- **CSS Variables & Scalability:** Applied a consistent design system using `--variables` for colors and spacing.  
- **Design Accessibility:** Improved text readability with overlays and balanced `text-wrap` behavior.  
- **Box Model Reset:** Applied a modern reset to standardize styling across browsers.

## üöß Challenges & Solutions

1. **Visual Form Validation Feedback**

    *Challenge*: Create clear and accessible validation feedback without JavaScript.

    *Solution*: Used CSS pseudo-classes (:valid, :invalid) and sibling selectors with pseudo-elements (::before) to display ‚úì and ‚úñ icons dynamically.

2. **Font Loading Optimization**

    *Challenge*: Integrate local fonts while keeping page performance high.

    *Solution*: Implemented @font-face with .woff2 priority and font-display: swap to prevent rendering delays.

3. **Layout & Spacing Management**

    *Challenge*: Balance content distribution between the image and form areas.

    *Solution*: Used Flexbox and CSS clamp() functions to create proportional and adaptive spacing.
